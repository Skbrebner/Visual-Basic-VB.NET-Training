Notes: Placing code in RunCode Sub routine or method. Starting with a string.This declaration contains all four parts: 
The dim keyword, the variable name, the data type, and the value. 
Next, we declare variables of a couple of diff data types. A string, a number,and a date. 
Then we set the data type of a number by setting the data type to integer.Then, we set the third data type of a date and 
return its value. Visual basic can be treated as a static or dynamic language. 
These first three declarations (DimmyString, Dim myNumber, and Dim myDate are) are static declarations. 
The next 3declarations, however, are dynamic delarations. The data types of the varliables are determined by the values that 
are being assigned. But, internally, the complieris inferring the literal values of the data and setting the data type without 
havingto say it explicitly (for ex. setting it to "As String" or "As Integer" or "As Date")
